The file called "InventoryManager.db" can never be deleted!! The program will not work right. If it has been deleted and not re-uploaded, upload another copy from the One drive, even if it is old, the raspberri pi will have the most updated copy and you can update it there. All you have to do is upload an old copy. Go to the Pi, run the InvManager program, and then close the GUI window. it will automatically upload the correct file.

Also, there are two versions of the code, raspberriapp.py and winddowsapp.py
DO NOT USE RASPBERRI ON WINDOWS AND VICE VERSA. 

The Raspberri app can read and write from the github which the computers cannot
The Windows app can only read to search the database.


ROADMAP
1. GUI can be resized with window resize
2. add features to be defined at a later date to windows app to make searching better.
